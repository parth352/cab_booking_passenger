# cab_booking_passenger
cab booking website for Passenger created in Springboot. (for Driver it is in progress.) 

created website but using multiple maps API which are free (Google maps, TomTom Maps, GraphHopper maps) reason for using multiple api 
is because each free API only provides limited features to use.

To run this project in your local system you need to create accounts and their api.
1. TomTom maps API.
2. GraphHopper maps API.
3. google maps (Optional).
4. Mysql DB. (DB name= location1);
